## üß¨ Overview

The Darwin G√∂del Machine (DGM) is an innovative implementation of self-improving AI agents that iteratively modify their own Python codebase to enhance their coding capabilities. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on formal proofs, DGM uses empirical validation through coding benchmarks to drive evolutionary improvement.

Based on the research paper **"Darwin G√∂del Machine: Open-Ended Evolution of Self-Improving Agents"** ([arXiv:2505.22954](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22954)), this implementation demonstrates how AI systems can achieve self-referential self-improvement through population-based exploration and empirical validation.

For more details, see the [official blog post](https://sakana.ai/dgm/) from Sakana AI.

### üîë Key Features

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **DGM Controller** (`dgm_controller.py`)
Orchestrates the main evolution loop:
- Parent selection from archive
- Self-modification coordination
- Benchmark evaluation
- Archive management

#### 2. **Agent System** (`agent/`)
LLM-powered coding agents with:
- Foundation Model integration
- Tool usage capabilities (Bash, File editing)
- Task solving and self-modification abilities

#### 3. **Archive Management** (`archive/`)
- **Agent Archive**: Stores all valid agents with scores
- **Parent Selector**: Chooses agents based on performance + novelty
- **Novelty Calculator**: Measures agent diversity

#### 4. **Evaluation System** (`evaluation/`)
- **Benchmark Runner**: Executes agents on coding challenges
- **Validator**: Ensures agents compile and maintain capabilities
- **Scorer**: Calculates performance metrics

#### 5. **Self-Modification** (`self_modification/`)
- **Diagnosis**: Analyzes agent performance issues
- **Proposal**: Generates improvement suggestions
- **Implementation**: Applies code modifications

## üìö Memory Bank System

The DGM includes a sophisticated **Memory Bank** system that maintains development context and project knowledge across sessions. This is crucial for understanding the project's evolution and current state.

### Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of five core files in the `memory-bank/` directory:

#### üìÑ `productContext.md`
- **Purpose**: High-level project overview and goals
- **Contains**: Project description, key features, overall architecture
- **Updated**: When fundamental project aspects change

#### üìä `activeContext.md`
- **Purpose**: Current project status and immediate context
- **Contains**: 
  - Current focus and priorities
  - Recent changes and progress
  - Open questions and issues
- **Updated**: Frequently during development

#### üèõÔ∏è `systemPatterns.md`
- **Purpose**: Recurring architectural patterns and design standards
- **Contains**: 
  - Coding patterns and conventions
  - Architectural decisions and rationale
  - Testing and validation patterns
- **Updated**: When new patterns emerge or existing ones evolve

#### üìã `decisionLog.md`
- **Purpose**: Record of significant architectural and implementation decisions
- **Contains**:
  - Decision descriptions with timestamps
  - Rationale and reasoning
  - Implementation details and implications
- **Updated**: When major technical decisions are made

#### ‚úÖ `progress.md`
- **Purpose**: Task tracking and completion status
- **Contains**:
  - Completed tasks with timestamps
  - Current tasks in progress
  - Next steps and planned work
- **Updated**: As tasks are completed or priorities change

### Using the Memory Bank

The Memory Bank serves multiple purposes:

1. **Development Continuity**: Maintains context across development sessions
2. **Decision Tracking**: Records why architectural choices were made
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Tracks project evolution and completion
4. **Knowledge Preservation**: Captures lessons learned and patterns discovered
5. **Collaboration**: Helps team members understand project state and history

When working on the DGM, always consult the Memory Bank to understand current context and update it when making significant changes.

## üîÑ How It Works

### The DGM Evolution Loop

1. **Initialize**: Start with a base agent in the archive
2. **Select Parent**: Choose an agent based on performance and novelty
3. **Self-Modify**: Agent analyzes its performance and proposes improvements
4. **Implement**: Agent modifies its own code based on the proposal
5. **Evaluate**: Test the modified agent on coding benchmarks
6. **Archive**: If valid and performs well, add to the agent archive
7. **Repeat**: Continue the cycle to drive continuous improvement

### Agent Capabilities

Each agent is a complete coding system that can:
- **Solve Coding Problems**: Use LLM reasoning to understand and solve tasks
- **Use Tools**: Execute bash commands and edit files
- **Self-Analyze**: Review its own performance and identify weaknesses
- **Self-Modify**: Propose and implement improvements to its own code
- **Maintain Validity**: Preserve its core capabilities while evolving

### Benchmark Examples

The system includes several coding challenges:

```yaml
# String Manipulation Challenge
name: reverse_with_numbers
description: "Reverse alphabetic characters while keeping numbers in place"
inputs: ["abc123def", "hello5world"]
expected_outputs: ["fed123cba", "dlrow5olleh"]
```

## üß™ Running Experiments

### Basic Evolution Run
```bash
# Run with default settings (3 generations)
python run_dgm.py

# Run with custom generation count
python run_dgm.py --generations 10

# Reset system state
python reset_dgm.py
```

### Monitoring Progress
```bash
# View archive contents
ls archive/agents/

# Check evaluation results
ls results/

# Monitor logs
tail -f dgm_run.log
```

### Testing Components
```bash
# Run full test suite
python test_harness.py

# Test specific components
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_agent.py
python -m pytest tests/integration/
```

## üìà Performance Tracking

The system tracks several metrics:

- **Agent Performance**: Benchmark scores over time
- **Archive Growth**: Number of valid agents discovered
- **Improvement Rate**: Frequency of successful enhancements
- **Diversity Metrics**: Novelty and variation in agent approaches

Results are stored in the `results/` directory with detailed JSON reports.

## üîí Safety Features

- **Sandboxed Execution**: All agent code runs in isolated Docker containers
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and time constraints
- **Validation Checks**: Ensure agents maintain core capabilities
- **Human Oversight**: Optional pause points for review
- **Rollback Capability**: Revert problematic modifications
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trail of all changes

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Connection Errors**
```bash
# Verify API keys
python test_fm_connection.py

# Check rate limits in provider console
```

**Agent Scoring 0.0**
```bash
# Check benchmark format compatibility
python test_benchmark_flow.py

# Verify agent code generation
python test_agent_code_extraction.py
```

**Memory Issues**
```bash
# Monitor Docker container resources
docker stats

# Adjust limits in dgm_config.yaml
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose logging
export PYTHONPATH=.
python run_dgm.py --log-level DEBUG

# Check conversation history
ls debug/conversation_history_*
```
