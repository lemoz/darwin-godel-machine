[2025-05-31 14:30:00] - Starting Phase 3 (Testing & Validation) - Creating unit tests, integration tests, and test harness for comprehensive validation of DGM components
[2025-05-31 14:47:26] - Phase 3 (Testing & Validation) - Created comprehensive test suite including unit tests for all core components (archive, evaluation, self-modification, DGM controller, agent, FM interface, tools) and integration tests for DGM loop, FM-tool integration, and benchmark evaluation. Also created test harness for running all tests.
[2025-05-31 15:46:09] - Created missing modules to resolve test failures: utils module (with logger.py), evaluation/scoring.py, and complete archive module (archive_manager.py, parent_selector.py, novelty_calculator.py). Test success rate improved from 51.72% to 72.62%.
[2025-05-31 15:55:00] - Fixed DiagnosisReport dataclass by adding missing prompt_engineering_issues field and corrected EditTool test to use get_description() method. Test success rate improved to 79.61% (82/103 tests passing).

[2025-05-31 16:25:00] - Updated all tests in test_agent.py to use new Agent constructor with AgentConfig. Test success rate remains at 74.14% (86/116 tests passing). Async tests showing warnings about coroutines not being awaited, suggesting test harness may need async test runner support.
[2025-05-31 16:30:00] - Fixed agent tests by adding missing imports (AgentConfig, Task, CompletionResponse, ToolCall). Test success rate improved to 76.72% (89/116 tests passing). All agent unit tests now passing. Remaining issues: 3 failures in evaluation and self-modification tests, 24 errors in other test files.
[2025-05-31 16:56:00] - **PHASE 4 STARTED**: Beginning End-to-End System Integration. Starting with API Configuration & Setup for real FM providers (Gemini and Anthropic).
[2025-05-31 17:00:00] - Created .env.example file with template for API keys and configuration loader utility (utils/config_loader.py) to handle environment variable substitution in config files
[2025-05-31 17:00:00] - Created test_fm_connection.py script to verify FM provider API connections before proceeding with integration
[2025-05-31 17:01:00] - Implemented full Anthropic provider replacing placeholder implementation, now supports Claude models with proper message formatting and tool calling
[2025-05-31 17:02:00] - **PHASE 4.1 COMPLETE**: API Configuration & Setup finished. Created README_PHASE4.md documenting setup instructions and next steps for benchmark integration
[2025-05-31 16:49:56] - **TASK COMPLETED**: Fixed 3 targeted failing tests - test_get_scorer, test_score_benchmark, and test_implement_proposal_dry_run. Success rate improved from 76.72% to 80.17%. All originally failing tests now pass.
[2025-05-31 17:28:00] - Successfully tested FM connections with updated models. Both Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (49 tokens used) and Claude Sonnet 4 (29 tokens used) are working correctly. Phase 4.1 (API Configuration & Setup) is now complete with the latest model versions.
[2025-05-31 21:00:29] - Completed fixing all integration test errors: parameter mismatches, import errors, configuration references, and attribute naming issues

[2025-05-31 21:04:41] - Starting actual DGM loop execution with basic benchmarks (string_manipulation, list_processing, simple_algorithm)
- [2025-05-31 21:46:00] - Phase 4.1 Integration Testing: Fixed all major integration issues (12+ fixes including parameter mismatches, attribute naming, config keys, API auth). DGM loop now runs with API calls. Next: Fix Gemini response parsing issue.
[2025-01-06 10:37:44] - Fixed BenchmarkTask attribute error
- Updated agents/initial/agent_0.py to handle BenchmarkTask objects correctly
- Changed type hints from Dict[str, Any] to Any
- Used getattr() for safe attribute access instead of dictionary .get() method
[2025-01-06 11:04:22] - Cleaned up old workspace agents
- Removed agents/workspace/ directory containing agents with incorrect implementations
- These agents were treating task as dictionary instead of BenchmarkTask object
- This should resolve the "'BenchmarkTask' object has no attribute 'get'" error
[2025-01-06 12:33:43] - Successfully fixed BenchmarkTask.get() error
- Identified mismatch between BenchmarkTask dataclass and scorer's dict expectation  
- Applied minimal fix in dgm_controller.py to create expected dict structure
- Avoided adding dual-type support that would create technical debt
- Ready to test if DGM can now evaluate benchmarks properly
[2025-06-01 12:49:15] - Fixed BenchmarkTask attribute error by creating minimal config dict in dgm_controller.py
[2025-06-01 12:49:15] - DGM now runs but encounters connection errors during self-modification after ~40 API calls
[2025-06-01 12:49:15] - All 3 generations failed with "Anthropic API error: Connection error" - possible rate limiting
[2025-06-01 12:59:30] - Fixed Anthropic handler timeout configuration - added timeout and max_retries parameters
[2025-06-01 12:59:30] - Ready to test if connection errors are resolved with proper timeout handling
[2025-06-01 13:16:30] - Implemented aggressive retry strategy: 5s initial delay, up to 60s max, 5 retries
[2025-06-01 13:16:30] - Ready to test if improved backoff resolves API timeout issues
[2025-06-01 13:59:02] - **Enhanced Agent Iteration Logging**: Added detailed logging to show agent response previews and task completion analysis. Will reveal why agent is looping without tool usage.
[2025-06-01 14:21:00] - **Completed**: Added comprehensive logging to Agent iteration loop and Anthropic provider to diagnose API call patterns
[2025-06-01 14:21:00] - **Completed**: Successfully identified root cause of self-modification failures through enhanced logging analysis
[2025-06-01 15:23:00] - **Completed Fix for Agent-Benchmark Output Mismatch**
- Successfully implemented solution for 0.0 benchmark scores
- Updated Agent system instructions to request markdown code blocks
- Added `_extract_code_solution()` method with robust regex pattern
- Tested code extraction with various response formats
- Agent now properly extracts Python code from LLM responses for benchmark evaluation
[2025-06-01 16:03:00] - Created reset_dgm.py utility script to clear all generated data and reset DGM to initial state
[2025-06-01 17:29:40] - Fixed critical agent execution issue: Implemented EditTool to enable agents to write solution files. Agents should now be able to complete benchmark tasks instead of failing with "not implemented" errors.
[2025-06-01 17:58:00] - Major success: EditTool implementation fixed agent execution! Agents can now write files and complete benchmark tasks. The DGM successfully ran through all 3 generations. New issue discovered: agents get stuck in infinite loops during self-modification phase.
[2025-06-02 08:55:00] - Fixed DGM configuration to use LLM-powered agent (agent/agent.py) instead of dummy hardcoded agent (agent_0.py). This aligns with research paper specification and should enable proper task solving and self-improvement.
[2025-01-06 11:15:00] - Completed implementation of AgentLoader abstraction
- Created utils/agent_loader.py with clean module loading interface
- Updated dgm_controller.py to use AgentLoader in _evaluate_agent method
- Updated agent_validator.py to use AgentLoader instead of temporary path fix
- Removed dummy agents directory (agents/initial/)
- All agent loading now goes through a consistent, clean abstraction
[2025-01-06 11:28:00] - Fixed method name mismatch
- DGM expects agents to have execute_task method
- Renamed solve_task to execute_task in agent/agent.py
- Ready to test the complete implementation
[2025-01-06 11:33:00] - Resolved method naming consistency
- Updated validator to expect solve_task instead of execute_task
- Reverted agent method name to solve_task
- All components now use consistent naming
## [2025-06-02 15:45:00] - Fixed Agent Infinite Loop Issue

**Completed**: Implemented multiple LLM calls per iteration to resolve infinite loops in agent evaluation

**Changes Made**:
1. Modified `_solve_with_iterations()` in agent/agent.py to support multiple steps per iteration
2. Added safety mechanisms (max 10 steps per iteration, nudging for stuck agents)
3. Updated system prompt to explain new workflow where agents can see tool results before declaring completion

**Result**: Agents can now write code, test it, debug if needed, and then explicitly signal completion - matching natural developer workflow
