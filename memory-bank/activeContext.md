## Recent Changes

*   [2025-05-31 14:56:37] - Ran comprehensive test suite using test_harness.py. Tests revealed significant mismatches between test expectations and Phase 1 implementation:
    *   Tests expect `FMInterface` class but implementation uses `ApiHandler`
    *   Tests expect provider names like `AnthropicProvider` but implementation uses `AnthropicHandler`
    *   Integration tests expect `dgm` module prefix that doesn't exist in current structure
    *   Tool classes missing expected attributes (e.g., `name` attribute)
    *   Test success rate: 51.72% (30/58 tests passed, 1 failure, 27 errors)
*   [2025-05-30 12:19:10] - Analyzing the DGM research paper ([`dgm_research_paper.md`](dgm_research_paper.md)) to fully understand its concepts and establish a comprehensive project context within the Memory Bank. (Ongoing as needed)

## Open Questions/Issues

*
*   [2025-05-30 14:01:23] - **Identified Challenges for DGM Implementation:**
    *   Computational cost and efficiency.
    *   Quality and reliability of FM-driven self-modifications.
    *   Benchmark faithfulness & potential for objective hacking.
    *   Design and effectiveness of open-ended exploration logic.

    *   Impact of the initial agent's design.
    *   Implementing secure and comprehensive sandboxing.
    *   Managing FM stochasticity for reproducibility.
*   [2025-05-30 14:01:23] - **Key Clarifications Needed for DGM Implementation:**
    *   Specific FMs for agent core and self-improvement diagnosis.
    *   Available computational budget and project timeline.
    *   Benchmark focus and any adaptations from the paper.
    *   Scope of self-modification (agent design only, or FM retraining later?).
    *   Definition of "interesting" for open-ended exploration.
    *   Level and type of human oversight during DGM runs.
*   [2025-05-31 13:48:12] - Beginning implementation of Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure) of DGM MVP as detailed in [`reference-design/dgm-mvp-architecture.md`](reference-design/dgm-mvp-architecture.md:1).
## Recent Changes
[2025-05-31 17:27:00] - Updated foundation model configurations to latest versions based on user feedback and API documentation. Gemini model updated to gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20 (preview model with 1M token input limit). Claude model updated to claude-sonnet-4-20250514 (latest Claude 4 Sonnet). Updated Anthropic provider validation to include Claude 4 model variants.
## Open Questions/Issues
[2025-05-31 17:53:42] - Waiting for user to verify API key ownership by checking for "DGM_TEST_2025-05-31 17:53:10_CDOSSMAN" in their Google AI Studio and Anthropic Console logs. This will confirm whether the .env file contains their actual API keys or the exposed ones from the original .env.example.
## Recent Changes
[2025-05-31 17:58:09] - Verified real API responses via custom query test. Both Gemini (2030 tokens) and Claude (216 tokens) provided coherent explanations of quantum entanglement, confirming functional API integration with the configured keys.
[2025-05-31 21:00:17] - Fixed final configuration reference issue in _evaluate_agent method by correcting path from `fm_providers.providers[primary_provider]` to `fm_providers[primary_provider]`
## Recent Changes
- [2025-05-31 21:46:00] - Successfully resolved DGM integration issues and API key authentication. Fixed environment variable expansion by adding dotenv loading to run_dgm.py. DGM loop now runs but encounters Gemini response parsing issue.
[2025-05-31 22:15:00] - **DGM API Integration Working**: Successfully resolved all attribute naming issues and API authentication. DGM now makes successful API calls to both Gemini (hits quota limit) and Anthropic (returns 200 OK responses). Current issue: Message formatting errors in Anthropic provider - "all messages must have non-empty content" and "final assistant content cannot end with trailing whitespace".
[2025-05-31 22:22:00] - **Critical Issue: Initial Agent Score 0.000**: The seed agent in the archive has a performance score of 0.000, meaning it's not successfully solving any benchmark tasks. This is a more fundamental issue than the self-modification errors - we need a working baseline agent before evolution can occur.
[2025-06-01 10:28:22] - Discovered root cause of initial agent 0.000 score: The initial agent was returning direct values instead of generating Python code. The benchmark runner expects agents to generate code with specific function definitions (e.g., `reverse_with_numbers`), which is then executed and tested. Updated `agents/initial/agent_0.py` to properly generate code solutions.
[2025-06-01 14:21:00] - **Enhanced Logging Analysis Complete**: Identified root cause of self-modification failures. Agent enters "analysis paralysis" after ~34 iterations, generating responses about exploring directories but not actually calling tools. The 60-second gaps are initial API requests timing out before retry mechanism activates.
[2025-01-06 11:04:54] - Resolved BenchmarkTask.get() error
- Root cause: Old workspace agents (self_modify_*) were treating task parameter as dictionary
- These agents used task.get() but benchmark runner passes BenchmarkTask object
- Fixed by removing agents/workspace/ directory with incorrect implementations
- System should now use correct initial agent from agents/initial/agent_0.py
## Current Focus
[2025-06-01 12:50:00] - Investigating connection errors during DGM self-modification after ~40 API calls per generation

## Recent Changes
[2025-06-01 12:50:00] - Fixed BenchmarkTask attribute error by creating minimal config dict at call site
[2025-06-01 12:50:00] - Connection errors now preventing agent self-modification (possible rate limiting)

## Open Questions/Issues
[2025-06-01 12:50:00] - Why do connection errors occur consistently after ~40 API calls?
[2025-06-01 12:50:00] - Is this rate limiting from Anthropic API or timeout issues?
[2025-06-01 12:50:00] - Need to implement better retry logic or add delays between API calls
[2025-06-01 13:53:23] - **API Call Analysis Complete**: Identified source of ~40 rapid API calls during self-modification. Each call is from Agent's iterative problem-solving loop (agent.py:206). System working as designed but hitting rate limits consistently around 40-call mark.
[2025-06-01 15:07:00] - **Identified Root Cause of 0.0 Benchmark Scores**
- The Agent's system instructions don't specify output format requirements
- Benchmarks expect Python code that defines functions (e.g., `def reverse_string(s): ...`)
- But Agent returns the LLM's full conversational response as the solution
- No code extraction logic exists to pull just the Python code from LLM responses
- Task completion is detected by phrases like "task complete" without format validation
[2025-06-01 15:52:00] - Found and fixed critical bug: benchmark_runner was passing generic description instead of detailed task_prompt to agents, causing 0.000 scores
[2025-06-01 16:55:00] - Fixed agent's infinite iteration issue by updating system instructions to explicitly require completion signals ("Task complete" or "Solution implemented")
[2025-06-01 17:05:55] - Added comprehensive LLM response logging to debug agent completion detection issue. The _is_task_complete() method checks for specific phrases like "task complete" or "solution implemented" in the agent's response.
[2025-06-01 21:36:00] - Fixed agent completion signaling issue with two-pronged approach: 1) Enhanced system prompt with crystal-clear instructions, warnings, and examples of correct completion signaling. 2) Improved _is_task_complete() method with better detection, comprehensive logging, and variant handling while still enforcing strict requirements.
[2025-06-02 17:28:00] - **CRITICAL FIX: Benchmark Format Compatibility Issue Resolved**
- **Problem**: Benchmark runner hardcoded to expect `string_manipulation.yaml` format (`input`/`expected`)
- **Impact**: `list_processing.yaml` (`input`/`expected_output`) and `simple_algorithm.yaml` (`inputs[]`/`expected_outputs[]`) caused KeyError exceptions
- **Solution**: Updated benchmark runner with format detection logic to handle all three benchmark structures
- **Result**: All benchmarks should now load test cases correctly, preventing 0.000 scores due to format mismatches
- **Status**: Ready for testing - the DGM should now properly score agents on all benchmarks
[2025-06-02 20:30:00] - **AGENT ARCHITECTURE SIMPLIFICATION: Removed Redundant Iteration Logic**
- **Problem**: Multiple iterations design was redundant after implementing multi-step approach
- **Solution**: Refactored agent from `_solve_with_iterations` to `_solve_with_steps`
- **Changes**: 
  - Removed outer iteration loop (was redundant)
  - Kept inner step loop (now up to 200 steps max)
  - Updated logging and return values to reflect step-based approach
- **Benefit**: Cleaner, more efficient code without behavioral changes
- **Evidence**: Agents were completing tasks in "Iteration 1" using multiple steps anyway
[2025-06-02 21:12:00] - **COMPLETED: Repository Test File Organization**
- Successfully organized all scattered test files into structured directories
- Created clear categorization: unit tests (10 files), integration tests (5 files), development tests (3 files)
- Added comprehensive documentation for development testing workflow
- Repository cleanup complete - Darwin Gödel Machine is now properly organized for public release
- All changes committed to GitHub with clear documentation
