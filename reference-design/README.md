# Reference Design for DGM MVP

This directory contains high-level design documents, architectural diagrams, and illustrative code samples to guide the development of the Darwin GÃ¶del Machine (DGM) Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

The goal is to capture key architectural decisions and patterns, providing a clear reference for implementation.

## Contents:

*   **`fm-interaction-layer.md`**: Describes the design for the Foundation Model (FM) interaction layer, including provider abstraction, message handling, and API communication.
*   **`tool-management.md`**: Describes the design for tool definition, parsing, dispatch, and execution.
*   **(Other documents to be added as design progresses)**

This reference design is based on insights from the DGM research paper, discussions, and analysis of existing systems like Roo-Code.
